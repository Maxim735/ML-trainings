- dl_course - directory with my solutions to deep learning problems

## dl_course Content
- several HSE homeworks
- **Pokemon Classification.** Implement experiments with pre-trained models(mobilenet_v2, resnet_50) with different features.

## ml_course Content.
- Linear Regression. Ipynb itself is the HSE homework solution. The task is **predicting the duration of a taxi ride**. Implemented EDA, work with cartographic data, search for anomalies in the data, and also implemented linear regression itself.
